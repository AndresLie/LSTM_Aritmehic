# LSTM Arithmetic

This project aims to utilize LSTM network to solve arithmethic question. The model takes arithmetic expressions as input and predicts the result directly from text sequences. This is a classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) task demonstrating the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically LSTM, for sequence-to-sequence learning.
